We use mediawiki format with some changes. See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting/ru for details.

To place images you are need this construction: !./image/path/img.png width='200px' (Alt Text)!
If you want link in image use this: [./path/to/large/image !./image/path/img.png width='200px' (Alt Text)!]

If you want uses preformated text put it's to 
{{{ 
	this 
			construction
}}}

'' italic ''
''' bold '''

Tables don't render right now. But this is alpha release. This feature will be added in future if it's will be need :)
