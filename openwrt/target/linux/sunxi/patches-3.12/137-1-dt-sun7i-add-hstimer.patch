Subject: [PATCH] ARM: sun7i: a20: Add support for the High Speed Timers
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The Allwinner A20 has support for four high speed timers. Apart for the
number of timers (4 vs 2), it's basically the same logic than the high
speed timers found in the sun5i chips.

Now that we have a driver to support it, we can enable them in the
device tree.

[dlezcano] : Fixed conflict with 428abbb8 "Enable the I2C controllers"
