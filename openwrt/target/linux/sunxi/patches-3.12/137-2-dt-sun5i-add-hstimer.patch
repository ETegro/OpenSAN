Subject: [PATCH] ARM: sun5i: a13: Add support for the High Speed Timers
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The Allwinner A13 has support for two high speed timers. Now that we
have a driver to support it, we can enable them in the device tree.
