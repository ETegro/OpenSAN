'''OpenSAN''' is a free software project realizing [[Storage Area Network]] system. This is small firmware that turns server into an [[iSCSI]] target accessible through the Ethernet interface.

It is intended to be easy configurable using user-friendly Web-interface. Nearly everything related to SAN can be configured from single Web-interface's page.

The project incorporates [[Trac]] for project management<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opensan.org/trac/wiki/ |title=OpenSAN trac}}</ref>, bug-tracking, and code development; [[Electronic mailing list|mailing list]] for discussion<ref>{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/group/opensan-discuss |title=OpenSAN discussion}}</ref>; [[Git (software)|Git]] source version control<ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/astor2-team/astor2 |title=OpenSAN source code}}</ref>.

== Features ==
* Physical drives and logical drives (either [[JBOD]] or [[RAID]]) management
** Supported RAID levels: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 10
** Dedicated hotspare drives support
** Online transparent growing capability
* WriteBack and WriteThrough caching policies switching
* Logical volumes management
** Virtually unlimited volumes quantity on single logical drive
** Logical volume resize support
** Snapshots support
* iSCSI targets management
* iSCSI-3 technology support
* iSCSI [[Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol|CHAP]] authentication support
* SSD caching capability
* [[IPv6]] protocol support
* Network bonding ability for gaining performance and reliability (including 802.3ad dynamic link aggregation protocol support)
* Comprehensive controller code unittesting and small so-called remotetesting framework to perform exhaustive benchmarking and testing of different system components and subsystems
* Text-mode console is also available on RS232 serial port
* Firmware updating through Web-interface form
* Command-line interface (CLI) accessibility via SSH 2.0 (with SCP support)
* Ability to backup overall configuration with restoring it later
* Network configuration can be done using either static IPv4, static IPv6 addressing and routing, DHCP or using bonded interfaces
* Real-time load average, traffic and connections monitoring
* Power supply, FAN, temperature, hard drive enclosure placement viewing, including additional SAS-attached JBOD expansion array overall information

== History ==
[[Inquisitor (hardware testing software)|Inquisitor]] project started own subproject ''Einarc'' — Ruby-written tool for managing various hardware RAID controllers, that introduced single API for related tests to be able to deal with different hardware configurations.

Later there appeared ''software'' Einarc module, that had similar and compatible API, but worked with software based Linux'es md-subsystem. Soon at 2010 ETegro Technologies decided to make a market level competing [[Network-attached storage|NAS]] software product: [http://astor.sourceforge.net/ aStor]. Free software and open source creation, based on [[Debian]] distribution, various related (Einarc/md, [[LVM2]], [[SAMBA]], [[ProFTPD]] and other) services with own [[Ruby On Rails]]-driven Web-interface.

However this project had some user interface performance issues and moreover guidance made a decision to move development into SAN solutions direction. All code related to RAID and LVM subsystems was reused and rewritten on [[Lua]] language and as a base distribution [[OpenWRT]] was chosen.

== Technical overview ==
[[File:OpenSAN-monitoring screenshot.png|thumb|250px|Web-interface screenshot of monitoring section]]
* [[Free software]] project, licenced under [[GNU GPLv3]]
* [[OpenWRT]] with own modified version of [[Linux]] is used as a base providing all necessary libraries, building framework and utilities to create lightweight, highly customized, easily upgradable environment for the following subsystems
* Built-in kernel md module provides RAID creation capability
* [[LuCI]] is used as MVC-framework for the overall Web-interface configuration management
* [[LVM2]] for logical volumes with snapshots management
* [http://scst.sourceforge.net/index.html SCST] framework for creating iSCSI targets
* [https://github.com/facebook/flashcache Flashcache] module for SSD caching support
* [[jQuery]] is used to make different pretty outlooking interface interactions
* All interaction with LVM2 and SCST subsystems is going through the self-written API (astor2. libraries) on Lua programming language
