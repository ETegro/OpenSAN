= Release 1.3.2 =
We are pleased to announce new OpenSAN's version.

== Release notes ==
* Bonding's “downdelay”, “updelay”, “miimon”, “mode”
  options are not necessary required.
* Maximal number of network bondings is 128, so practically
  there is not any limit.
* Bonding interfaces can have any visible user-defined ASCII name
  (as with all other interfaces).

All users upgrading from 1.3.1 or earlier versions should not worry
about new bonding-related configuration format. This version is fully
compatible with it.
