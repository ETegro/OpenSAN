= Release 1.1 =

This release brings two important features:

* **Caching policies** changing support: now, user can distinguish
  between write back and write through logical drive's mode of
  operation. Write back policy allows some buffering (caching) of write
  operations, while write through performs writing directly to the hard
  drives. This mode also forces disabling of all hard drive's internal
  write caching.  User can switch to this mode by setting “WriteThrough
  mode” in one of corresponding to logical disk access patterns. This
  mode will be applied to the whole logical disk.
* Disk subsystem **performance optimizations**: various fine tweaks of
  I/O scheduler's (CFQ) queue behaviour, buffer sizes and read-ahead
  support.
