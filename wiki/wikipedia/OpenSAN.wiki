'''OpenSAN''' is a free software project realizing [[Storage Area Network]] system. This is small firmware that turns server into an  [[iSCSI]] target accessible through the Ethernet interface.

It is intended to be easy configurable using user-friendly Web-interface. Nearly everything related to SAN can be configured from single Web-interface's page.

== Features ==
* Physical drives and logical drives (either [[JBOD]] or [[RAID]]) management
** Supported RAID levels: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 10
** Dedicated hotspare drives support
** Online transparent growing capability
* WriteBack and WriteThrough caching policies switching
* Logical volumes management
** Virtually unlimited volumes quantity on single logical drive
** Logical volume resize support
** Snapshots support
* iSCSI targets management
* iSCSI-3 technology support
* iSCSI [[Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol|CHAP]] authentication support
* [[IPv6]] protocol support
* Network bonding ability for gaining performance and reliability (including 802.3ad dynamic link aggregation protocol support)
* Comprehensive controller code unittesting and small so-called remotetesting framework to perform exhaustive benchmarking and testing of different system components and subsystems
* Text-mode console is also available on RS232 serial port
* Firmware updating through Web-interface form
* Command-line interface (CLI) accessibility via SSH 2.0 (with SCP support)
* Ability to backup overall configuration with restoring it later
* Network configuration can be doned using either static IPv4, static IPv6 addressing and routing, DHCP or using bonded interfaces
* Real-time load average, traffic and connections monitoring
* Power supply, FAN, temperature, hard drive enclosure placement viewing, including additional SAS-attached JBOD expansion array overall information

== Technical overview ==
[[File:OpenSAN-monitoring screenshot.png|thumb|250px|Web-interface screenshot of monitoring section]]
* [[Free software]] project, licenced under [[GNU GPLv3]]
* [[OpenWRT]] with own modified version of [[Linux]] is used as a base providing all necessary libraries, building framework and utilities to create lightweight, highly customized, easily upgradable environment for the following subsystems
* Built-in kernel md module provides RAID creation capability
* [[LuCI]] is used as MVC-framework for the overall Web-interface configuration management
* [[LVM2]] for logical volumes with snapshots management
* [http://scst.sourceforge.net/index.html SCST] framework for creating iSCSI targets
* [[jQuery]] is used to make different pretty outlooking interface interactions
* All interaction with LVM2 and SCST subsystems is going through the self-written API (astor2. libraries) on Lua programming language
