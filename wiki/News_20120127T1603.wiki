= Release 1.5.6 =
We are pleased to announce new OpenSAN's version.

== Release notes ==
This is bugfix release:
* SCST subsystem requires LUN0 existence. Now you are forced to use LUN0
  for the first binded AccessPattern. Also you can not unbind LUN0 if
  other LUNs exist.
* Fixed possible Snapshot's size calculation. It can not be larger than
  free space on Logical drive anyway.
* Fixed issue with inability to bind AccessPattern to the Snapshot.
