OpenSAN is based on several other free software projects:

[http://www.openwrt.org/ OpenWRT] with own modified version of Linux
is used as a base providing all necessary libraries, building framework
and utilities to create lightweight, highly customized, easily
upgradable environment for the following subsystems.

[http://luci.subsignal.org/ LuCI] is used as MVC-framework for the
overall Web-interface configuration management.

[http://www.inquisitor.ru/doc/einarc/ Einarc] with software module
enabled -- all configuration related to physical and logical drives
management is performed through it.

[http://sourceware.org/lvm2/ LVM2] for logical volumes with snapshots
management.

[http://scst.sourceforge.net/index.html SCST] framework for creating
iSCSI targets.

[http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/smartmontools/wiki Smartmontools]
utility programs to control and monitor storage systems using SMART

[http://jquery.com/ jQuery] is used to make different pretty
outlooking interface interactions.

All interaction with Einarc, LVM2 and SCST subsystems is going through
the self-written API (**astor2.** libraries) on Lua programming language.
