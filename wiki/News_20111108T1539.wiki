= Release 1.4.2 =
We are pleased to announce new OpenSAN's version.

== Release notes ==
This release contains several very important bugfixes:

* All available hard drives have disabled any power management
  capabilities and power saving modes.
* AccessPatterns pointing to non-existent device targets won't be
  applied and tried to be configured. System will just skip them.
  That will help if dirty SCST's configuration is on.
