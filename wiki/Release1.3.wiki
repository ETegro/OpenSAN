Appeared ability to bond multiple networking interfaces together. One
can use several interfaces as single virtual channel with specified
properties, varying between reliability and performance targets. Bonding
capability fully relies on Linux built-in “bonding” kernel module,
providing six bonding policies:

* round-robin balancing (providing load balancing and fault tolerance)
* active backup (single acting interface) (only fault tolerance)
* XOR balancing (load balancing and fault tolerance)
* broadcasting (all interfaces are active) (only fault tolerance)
* IEEE 802.3ad dynamic link aggregation

Our bonding implementation use only MII-based link monitoring. ARP is
not a choice, as it is too IPv4-biased, although it does not require
lower-level device drivers necessary MII support.
